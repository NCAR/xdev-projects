# Project: Spring 2020 Python Tutorial

## Overview
We want to conduct a Python tutorial for the late-March / early-April time-frame.
We need to assess what the need is from the community, namely do people need/want
a beginner-track tutorial?  Intermediate?  Or advanced?  What do we need to do with
our tutorial materials to get ready for this?  When do those materials need to be
completed?  Etc.

### Tutorial Target Audience
NCAR-staff & their external collaborators

## Repositories
NCAR/ncar-python-tutorial
NCAR/”python-setup-scripts” (?)

## Dependencies
Previous implementations in NCAR/ncar-python-tutorial and other tutorial materials
(ncar-hackathons/???, ...)

## Deliverables - Functionality
1. Survey to solicit input for what tutorial we provide
   1. Combine with registration?
2. Provide scripts to setup Python environments for tutorial participants
3. Provide education material for Beginner Track
   1. Intro to Python
   2. Intro to Jupyter Notebooks
   3. Intro to Git & GitHub
   4. Intro to Numpy
   5. Intro to Pandas
   6. Intro to matplotlib & cartopy
4. Provide educational material for Intermediate Track (solving common problems in terms that the participants understand...as opposed to just topic-by-tool)
   1. Xarray w/ Dask
   2. NCAR Jobqueue
   3. Holoviews
   4. Cartopy (?)
   5. Unstructured grids (plotting and analysis)
   6. intake / intake-esm
5. Curriculum for Advanced Track
   1. Should this be infrastructure for a hackathon?
   2. Should this be classroom-based?
      1. e.g., Dask (Advanced)
      2. Numba, Cython, f2py, etc.
   3. Mix of both?
