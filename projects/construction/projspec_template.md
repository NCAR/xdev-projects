## Milestones & Timeline

Milestones should be tied to each deliverable.  While a detailed description of each deliverable
should be given in the previous section, this section should reference each deliverable using
a "short name" and tie to each deliverable a deadline.  Use whatever means you like for indicating
if a milestone has been completed or not.  (This may need a better interface than a markdown
document for this.)
