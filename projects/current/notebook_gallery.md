# Project: {Notebook Gallery}

Notebook Gallery Deployment

## Campaigns:

- WORKFLOWS

## Overview

The purpose of the notebook gallery is twofold: to provide a location to showcase example workflows demonstrating Pangeo recommended tools such as Xarray, Dask, and NCAR-specific developmens (intake-esm) in order to help educate and train both geoscientists and future members of the Pangeo development community, and to encourage the development of future workflow examples by providing a standard and said platform for the produced Jupyter notebooks.

## Repositories

notebook-gallery

## Skills & Knowledge

- Jupyter Notebooks
- Python
- Xarray
- Dask
- Intake-ESM
- Cartopy and plotting tools
- Nikola (or similar blogging tool)

## Deliverables

- Project planning (meet with scientist, understand original code, question, and shortcomings)
- Development and Coding
- Compare results with scientist and output from original code
- Improve presentation (refactoring, potentially turn into a tutorial)
- Create a blog post (archive in a gallery on the Xdev blog)
- Complete at least one new notebook per quarter
